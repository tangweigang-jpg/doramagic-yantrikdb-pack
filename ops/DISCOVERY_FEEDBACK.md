# Discovery Feedback Contract

This repository can produce feedback signals for Doramagic Discovery Agent, but those signals must be treated as product-consumption evidence, not as proof of human satisfaction by themselves.

Signals to collect:

- Stars: lightweight save/bookmark intent.
- Unique clones: install or inspection intent; bot traffic and CI must be considered possible.
- Views and referrers: discovery channel signal.
- Issues: direct user problem reports, usage questions, and pitfall reports.
- Forks and PRs: stronger reuse or contribution signal.
